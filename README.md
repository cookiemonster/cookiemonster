### Bio (written by ChatGPT):
Victor Gevers is a world-renowned Dutch cybersecurity expert, ethical hacker, and advocate for a safer internet. With over three decades of experience, he has consistently exposed significant data breaches and vulnerabilities, notably in China. His groundbreaking discoveries include the "[SenseNets](https://www.ft.com/content/9ed9362e-31f7-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812)" facial recognition database used to track the Muslim population in Xinjiang, and the controversial "[BreedReady](http://time.com/5548917/research-china-database-breedready-women/)" database categorizing 1.8 million Chinese women based on their childbearing potential.

In 2019, Gevers unearthed a massive data breach compromising the private messages and personal information of [364 million Chinese users](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250474/chinese-messages-millions-wechat-qq-yy-data-breach-police) on platforms like [WeChat](https://github.com/cookiemonster/WeChat) and QQ, highlighting the invasive surveillance practices of the Chinese government. This discovery contributed to the subsequent [ban of WeChat](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/09/wechat-banned-tiktok-saved/) in the United States due to national security concerns.

Featured in episodes 87 and 88 of the Darknet Diaries podcast, Gevers delves into his investigations, including the 2016 LinkedIn data breach and high-profile incidents like hacking President Trump's Twitter account in 2016 and 2020.

Today, Gevers is dedicated to nurturing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. He mentors aspiring IT students through the [DIVD Academy](https://divd.academy/) ’s internship program and leads the research and development department at the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), tirelessly working towards a more secure digital world.
