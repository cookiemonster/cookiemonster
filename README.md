### Bio (_written by Gemini 1.5 pro_):
> Victor Gevers is a world-renowned Dutch cybersecurity expert, ethical hacker, and advocate for a safer internet. With over three decades of experience, he has  consistently exposed significant data breaches and vulnerabilities, notably in China. His groundbreaking discoveries include the "[SenseNets](https://www.ft.com/content/9ed9362e-31f7-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812)" facial recognition database used to track the Muslim population in Xinjiang, and the controversial "[BreedReady](http://time.com/5548917/research-china-database-breedready-women/)" database categorizing 1.8 million Chinese women based on their childbearing potential.

>  In 2019, Gevers unearthed a massive data breach compromising the private messages and personal information of [364 million Chinese users](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250474/chinese-messages-millions-wechat-qq-yy-data-breach-police) on platforms like [WeChat](https://github.com/cookiemonster/WeChat) and QQ, highlighting the invasive surveillance practices of the Chinese government. This discovery contributed to the subsequent [ban of WeChat](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/09/wechat-banned-tiktok-saved/) in the United States due to national security concerns.

> Featured in episodes [87]([url](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/87/)) and [88]([url](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/88/)) of the [Darknet Diaries podcast](https://darknetdiaries.com), Gevers delves into his investigations, including the 2016 LinkedIn data breach and high-profile incidents like hacking President Trump's Twitter account in 2016 and 2020.

> Today, Gevers is dedicated to nurturing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. He mentors aspiring IT students through the [DIVD Academy](https://divd.academy/) 's internship program. He leads the research and development department at the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), tirelessly working towards a more secure digital world.
